								Non-terrestrial networks" encompass a broad spectrum of communication and connectivity systems that operate beyond the confines of Earth's surface. These networks primarily include satellite networks, which utilize artificial satellites orbiting the Earth to facilitate communication, data transmission, broadcasting, and various other services. Additionally, non-terrestrial networks can extend to interplanetary communication systems, which enable data exchange between spacecraft, rovers, and orbiters exploring celestial bodies such as planets, moons, and asteroids within our solar system.

								Satellite networks play a pivotal role in global connectivity, offering ubiquitous coverage even in remote or geographically challenging areas where traditional terrestrial infrastructure is limited or unavailable. These networks support a wide range of applications, including telecommunications, internet access, television broadcasting, navigation systems (e.g., GPS), weather monitoring, and disaster management.

								Interplanetary communication systems are designed to establish communication links between Earth-based stations and space probes, landers, rovers, and orbiters exploring other celestial bodies. These systems utilize sophisticated communication protocols and technologies to transmit data over vast distances and cope with the challenges posed by deep space exploration, such as signal degradation, long propagation delays, and limited bandwidth

								Non-terrestrial networks represent a critical enabler for scientific research, exploration, and commercial activities in space. They facilitate the exchange of data, commands, and telemetry between spacecraft and ground control centers, enabling real-time monitoring, control, and analysis of space missions. Moreover, these networks support international collaboration in space exploration, allowing multiple space agencies, research institutions, and commercial entities to cooperate on joint missions and share scientific discoveries and resources.
